## Workshop: Fundamentals of Containerization for ESOC

### Date: 
Thursday, January 30, 2020, 12:30 am - 3:30 pm

### Location: 
University of Colorado Boulder, Ekeley W230

### Instructor 
Andrew Monaghan, [Research Computing](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/), University of Colorado

### Description: 
Would you like to be able to move, share or publish your software without worrying whether it will work properly on other computers? Containerization is an OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine for each app. Containers are "stand-alone", enabling workflows to be easily packaged and shared across platforms, enhancing reproducibility and portability. The objectives of the tutorial will be to:
* provide you with an overview of containerization, and
* demonstrate how to run containers on the CU high-performance computer (HPC), [RMACC Summit](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/resources/summit), through a series of hands-on examples. 
 
You’ll learn to use an “HPC-safe” containerization software called [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/). Singularity can run a variety of containers, including those that were built using the widely-used [Docker](https://www.docker.com) software (Docker itself cannot be used on HPC platforms because it requires users to have administrative privilege).   

__Agenda__
* 12:30-2:00p: Container overview, running containers on RMACC Summit
* 2:00-2:15p: Break
* 2:15-3:30p: Running the Alaska Sar Facility [apt-insar](https://github.com/ResearchComputing/asf-insar-singularity) container on RMACC Summit

### Prerequisites: 

If you’d like to participate in the hands-on exercises, you’ll need the following:

* If you don’t have a NASA Earthdata account, please [register](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/earthdata-login). You’ll need your Earthdata username and password for the tutorial.
* If you don’t have a Research Computing account, please [register](https://rcamp.rc.colorado.edu/accounts/account-request/create/verify/ucb). Once you’ve registered we will send instructions for setting up 2-factor authentication (by installing an app called “Duo” on your phone).
* You’ll need an ssh client on your laptop so that you can login to Research Computing resources. If you have a Mac, no need to worry – there is already a Terminal application.  If you have a Windows laptop, you can install either [GitBASH](https://gitforwindows.org) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org)
